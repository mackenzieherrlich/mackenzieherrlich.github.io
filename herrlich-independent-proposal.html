	<p><b>Project Name:</b> Trigger Warning Display Revamp
</p>
	<p><b>Overview: </b>Improve how social media sites display content that may have certain triggers or sensitive content that affect users. Many sites donâ€™t provide adequate warnings to sensitive content that serve as triggers to many people. As a result of inadequate trigger warnings, many people could/can be harmed physically/emotionally as a result. Media sites and apps should provide all content that is user friendly to all users. A revamp of trigger warnings for how social media sites/apps present their content will be a better way to accommodate all users. The revamp would display a screen/blur of content of the types of triggers that may be what affects certain users. The trigger warning/sensitive content could be set up in the settings of the app for all users to choose whether or not they want sensitive content to be hidden and certain triggers the app should avoid sharing with users. 
</p>
	<p><b>Goals: </b>The goals of this project is to make content on social media accessible for all users, understand all possible users affected, create a set of guidelines for social media sites to use in regards to sensitive content, and change how sensitive content can be posted and displayed.</p>
	<p><b>Audience: </b>(1) Users affected by sensitive content and/or have certain triggers. (2) Users not affected by sensitive content and/or have certain triggers but would like to be made aware of the sensitive content and/or triggers posted on the site/app. (3) Users not affected by sensitive content and/or have certain triggers that do not care about being shown sensitive content and/or content with triggers.</p>
