	<h2>"What's Your Story?" Assignment</h2>
	<p>My name is Mackenzie Herrlich, I am a junior at James Madison University and I am an aspiring Graphic Designer. 
		<br>I am a very open minded person and I do well when working with others but I also can be independent and stubborn at times. 
		<br>I can be indecisive when it comes to making decisions because I always want to know that I am making the right one.</p>
	<h4>Website Pages</h4>
	<p>These pages would be used for my own personal site for a user to navigate.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Home Page</li>
		<li>Portfolio</li>
		<li>Resume</li>
		<li>Gallery</li>
		<li>About Me</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The <b>Home Page</b> would serve as an overview for the whole site with little snippets/summaries for each page.
	<br> The <b>Portfolio</b> page would serve as a gallery/page full of the previous work and projects that I have done.
	<br> The <b>Resume</b> page would display my resume.
	<br>The <b>Gallery</b> page would serve as displaying artwork, projects, and other images that are inspirational to me or don't fit to the description of my portfolio.
	<br> The <b>About Me</b> is a page with a short biography about me.</p>
